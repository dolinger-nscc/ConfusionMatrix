# Creating a "Seaborn Confusion Matrix"

## Overview
When testing classification models I frequently require a confusion matrix. Seaborn, being my go to for visual analysis, does not have an out of the box confusion matrix visualization. This short project illustrates how to create a wrapper to provide this functionality when testing classification predictive results.
