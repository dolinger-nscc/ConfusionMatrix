# Creating a "Seaborn Confusion Matrix"

## Overview
When testing classification models I frequently require a confusion matrix. Seaborn, being my go to for visual analysis, does not have an out of the box confusion matrix visualization. This short project illustrates how to create a wrapper to provide this functionality when testing classification predictive results. 

## Data
The data used is a mock-up of results from an RGB classification model. The use-case is there is a target called colour and the three classifications of colour are Red, Green, and Blue.
